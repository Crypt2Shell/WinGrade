You can execute it in every Windows Operating System from Windows 7 - 10.

You dont have to Download the Program directly in github.


Just execute:

powershell -nop -exec bypass -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crypt2Shell/WinGrade/master/scripts/search.ps1')"



In the Windows Command Prompt.


This Script is still in the early Alpha release!!! And has some bugs
